# Changelog

## v1.9.0 (2026-04-02)

### Features

**Multi-account token pooling** (`packages/proxy`) — transparently pool multiple Anthropic API keys / Claude Max OAT tokens and select the best available one per request.

- **Auto-detect incoming tokens**: tokens sent by Claude Code, Cursor, or any client via `Authorization: Bearer` are registered in the pool automatically (priority 10). Zero config change required for single-account users.
- **Explicit config accounts**: add additional tokens under `providers.anthropic.accounts[]` in `~/.relayplane/config.json` (priority 0 by default = tried first). Perfect for users with 2+ Claude Max subscriptions.
- **Smart selection**: pool skips rate-limited tokens and proactively throttles at 90% of the known upstream RPM limit. Ties broken by fewest requests this minute.
- **Transparent 429 retry**: if the selected token receives a 429, the proxy immediately retries with the next available token. Accurate `retry-after` is returned to the client only when all tokens are exhausted.
- **Learn from headers**: `anthropic-ratelimit-requests-limit`, `anthropic-ratelimit-requests-remaining`, and `retry-after` headers are observed on every response to keep per-token rate-limit state fresh.
- **Status endpoint**: `GET /v1/token-pool/status` returns per-account label, priority, requests-this-minute, known RPM limit, and rate-limit expiry.
- **Dashboard widget**: new "Token Pool" collapsible section in the embedded dashboard shows live per-token status and a utilisation bar.

### Config example

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "anthropic": {
      "accounts": [
        { "label": "newmax", "apiKey": "sk-ant-oat01-...", "priority": 0 },
        { "label": "default", "apiKey": "sk-ant-oat01-...", "priority": 1 }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Backward compatible: single-token users (env var `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or incoming auth passthrough) see no behaviour change.
